Welcome to **My Data Wonderland**! 🎉📊
Hey there, curious human! You’ve stumbled upon my GitHub, a collection of my digital musings and creations. I’m a data analyst with a passion for turning numbers into stories, data into insights, and complex problems into solutions. If you’ve ever found yourself diving into the depths of data and emerged victorious, we’re on the same page!

Who Am I? 🤔
I’m a data enthusiast who loves exploring the realms of:

**IBM Planning Analytics** – because who doesn't love a good cube to slice and dice? 🧊
**Power BI** – my go-to for creating dashboards that make people say, "Wow, this is so intuitive!" 📈
**Azure SQL Serve**r – where my data lives and plays. It's my happy place. ☁️

The Code I Speak 💻
You’ll often find me speaking these languages fluently:

**SQL** – the language of databases, also known as "how I make the data dance." 💃🕺
**Python** – because I like my data to be pythonic and my scripts to be clean. 🐍

But that’s not all! I’m also proficient in data manipulation languages and analytical expressions such as:

**M Code** – my secret sauce for Power Query transformations. 🔮
**TurboIntegrator** – yes, it’s as fast as it sounds. ⏩
**DAX** – because when in doubt, I just DAX it out. ⚡
**MDX**- – for when I want to really slice through cubes like a pro. 🍰

Currently Learning 📚
I’m now diving into the wonderful world of **web development**! 🌐 It’s all about:

**HTML** – the skeleton of the web (just don’t ask me to design it). 🏗️
**CSS** – I’m learning how to make things look pretty (it’s a work in progress). 🎨
**JavaScript** – because interactivity is the name of the game. ⚙️

I’ll be pushing my web projects here too, so stay tuned for some interesting (and maybe quirky) web pages as I learn the ropes.

<!-- What's in the Repo? 📂
In this repository, you’ll find:

SQL queries that solve problems faster than you can say "SELECT * FROM."
Python scripts that analyze and visualize data (sometimes they even tell jokes!).
MDX and DAX formulas that perform some real data wizardry.
Web development projects (soon to come, once I’ve figured out how to make a button work properly).
Let’s Connect! 🌍
Feel free to fork, clone, or just stare in awe at the magic happening here. I love collaborating, learning, and talking data—so don’t hesitate to reach out, whether it’s for a cool project or a good meme.

Thanks for stopping by and remember: Data is not just numbers; it's the key to solving real-world puzzles. 🔑✨

Now go ahead, dive into the code, and may your data always be clean and your queries always run fast! 🚀

P.S. If you can’t find the answer here, try Googling "How to make data fun" and you’ll probably end up right back here. 😉 -->
